## Setup Email Credentials

   To send email reports, you need to configure your email credentials:
   Create a .env file in the root directory of the project if it doesnâ€™t exist.
   Add your Outlook email credentials and the recipient email in the .env file:

   - ***USERNAME=your_email@domain.com***
   - ***PASSWORD=your_password***
   - ***TO_RECEPIENTS=recipient_email@domain.com***

Important: If you do not fill out the .env file, you will need to run the tests without emailing the reports.

## Running Tests
   **Option 1: With Email Reports**
   If you have configured the .env file with your email credentials, run the following command to execute the tests and send the email report:

   ***npm run fancodeAssignment***

   **Option 2: Without Email Reports**
   If you choose not to set up the email credentials, run the tests without sending an email report using:

   ***npm run test***

## Scripts
   - **npm run test**: Runs the Cypress tests and generates a Mochawesome report. No email will be sent.
   - **npm run fancodeAssignment**: Runs the tests and sends the email report if the .env file is properly configured.
